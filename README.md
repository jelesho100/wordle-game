About
-   It is a wordl game

Built With
-   Javascript, HTML, and CSS

Getting Started
-   Each guess must be a valid five-letter word.
-   The color of a tile will change to show you how close your guess was.
-   If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word, and it is in the correct spot.
-   If the tile turns yellow, the letter is in the word, but it is not in the correct spot.
-   You have 3 tries. Wordle difficulty Impossible

Testing
-   I tested it my actually playing it like a Wordle game
-   Tested the green, yellow, gray logic
-   Tested the random word generator logic

Challenges & Wins
-   A major challenge was getting the user to be able input the word in the next row after clicking enter
-   Got help from a friend. Manually increment valid entries and userRow at the same time
-   Relearned about the push method for arrays.

Next Steps
-   Optimize the way I check which row the user is now. Right now it is hard coded.
-   Add a delay in the flip animation per letter aka not having the tiles flip at the same time
-   Add an X button image to the undo button. Like the one wordle has
